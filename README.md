# My Digital Double

**"My Digital Double"** is a net art design project focused on uncovering the complex interplay between surveillance and online advertising. Upon visiting our website, a Digital Double materializes â€“ a spectral embodiment crafted from data collected by third-party cookies during the visitor's browsing session.

This project transcends boundaries, catering to all internet users. It delves into the ubiquitous nature of third-party cookies, notorious for tracking user behavior and building virtual profiles. While these cookies personalize the online experience with targeted ads, they also raise profound concerns regarding privacy and surveillance.

Harnessing web programming and leveraging the Voyant visualization tool via API, our repository breathes life into Digital Doubles. Visitors are confronted with a visual representation of their online persona in the form of a human-shaped word cloud, showcasing tags of varying sizes and relevance. This visualization offers insight into how algorithms and marketers perceive individuals, serving as a stark reminder that on the internet, we are both browsers and the browsed.
